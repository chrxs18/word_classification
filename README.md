Movie ratings sentiment prediction
We are given a dataset in IMDB-Dataset.csv constituted by two columns. A text review column
and a sentiment column. Review column is constituted by text written by a user to give
comments about a movie. The sentiment column contains usersâ€™ sentiment about the movie,
0 for negative sentiment, and 1 for positive sentiment.
The goal of this exercise is to implement in Keras a model to predict sentiment from word
occurrences
